The beta version of Sanming University School of Information Engineering new official webside.  
It based on PHP7.0.8, MySQL5.As for the part of UI, we use HTML5+CSS3 which are popular at present.  
It can be deployed on Windows Server(2008 R2 or later) and Ubuntu(14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS have been tested).  
Maybe it has some BUGs, we will repaire it later.  
As the Syaing goes "Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth.", during the developing process, we practiced and improved ourselves.
